storyStateOnDefectCreation
=========================

## Overview

Teams often have their own states in the development process, e.g. a Kanban board or wallboard. This app allows you to see the state the associated User Story was in when the defect was created. It looks purely at the first entry for the 'day' the defect was created, not down to the minute or second. I.e. not that specific.

It can be used for any drop-down field, e.g. ScheduleState, TeamKanbanState.
